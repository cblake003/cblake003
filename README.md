Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hey there! 👋 I'm Cameron Blake, a full-stack engineer and proud graduate of General Assembly's SEI BootCamp. I'm passionate about coding and love diving into complex problem-solving. My toolkit includes JavaScript and Python, and I have hands-on experience with the MERN stack. When I'm not writing code, you can find me practicing martial arts, playing sports, indulging in video games, or getting lost in a good book. I'm also a firm believer in the power of teamwork and collaboration.
